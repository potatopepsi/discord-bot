I changed how current.json looks. Please refer to the newly edited
json file to see how you need to parse in attack or defense.

This is going to affect how you take in defense and attacks now because of how
the new format is listed, sorry.

In order to use current.py 
import current at the top of mobs.py 
and call current.<command> 
The only command you'll probably need is 
current.clear() after you finish taking in the entire list of attack, defense, or heal.
You no longer need to account for different spelling, I will handle that 
as users are typing it in. Sorry again.


Winning instances:
    Call the loot function on everyone.
    If they get a weapon, or armor - [Remember that armor is split into four names]
        Then add that to their backpack
    If they get money, call the addCurrency field in loot.py
    Increase their exp. This needs to be an exp function to make it easier.
        ->If they reach xyz exp, level up, and set exp to 0.
        ->However, if they died - no loot, no extra exp.

Please update your damage from the mob. 
Firstly, the mob will be taking both magic damage, and attack damage.
Refer to !classes to see which classes will be doing magic damage, and which will be doing attack damage
Basically - the mob will have a base hp, with a random magic/attack armor.
So depending on the info of the person that's attacking it - deal with it accordingly.
Reminder - current.json will give you who is attacking by id and what they're doing,
but, you'll need to go into user.json for actual user info.

Also, update how mob attacks. You should be giving users an update after
each round, the state of their hp.
Their hp is affected by a random mob damage - the defense of their armor.


Loss Instances:
    Decrease their exp. Their health should be set back to 50.

If the third round is reached, all players should lose.
Since there are no more rounds.
